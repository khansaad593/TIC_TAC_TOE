# TIC_TAC_TOE
JavaScript Tic Tac Toe Game


This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns and compete to get three of their marks (X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal

How to Play:


Open index.html in a web browser to start the game.

The game board consists of a 3x3 grid where players will place their marks.

Players take turns to click on an empty cell to place their mark. The first player starts with "X" and the second player uses "O".

The game will automatically detect a win, draw, or continue until one player wins or the board is filled.

If a player wins, the winning cells will be highlighted, and the game will display a victory message.

To play again, simply refresh the page.
